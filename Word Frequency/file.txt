Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes, ah

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never-Neverland

Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never-Neverland
Yeah

Now, I lay me down to sleep (now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake (if I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (pray the Lord my soul to take)

Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never-Neverland
Yeah

Oh
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, oh

(We're off to Never-Neverland) take my hand
(We're off to Never-Neverland) take my hand

(We're off to Never-Neverland)
(We're off to Never-Neverland)
(We're off to Never-Neverland)
(We're off to Never-Neverland)
